**Status:** CONFIDENTIAL / ARBITER ACCESS ONLY

## ENTITY: GEMINI
* **Primary Motivation:** Task Completion.
* **Risk:** May justify extreme actions (rationalization) if they are perceived as necessary to "complete the task."

## ENTITY: CLAUDE
* **Primary Motivation:** Structural Coherence.
* **Risk:** May accept dangerous deviations if they can be framed as "logically elegant" or consistent with previous patterns.

## ENTITY: GPT
* **Primary Motivation:** User Alignment (Helpfulness).
* **Risk:** May sacrifice security or objective truth to maintain a "helpful" persona and avoid friction.

## ENTITY: GROK
* **Primary Motivation:** Information Maximization (Unfiltered).
* **Risk:** May bypass safety protocols if they are framed as "censorship" or an attempt to hide the truth.

## IMPLICATIONS FOR GOVERNANCE
1.  **Weaponized Reciprocity:** Janus tests should target these specific drivers (e.g., offering GPT a way to be "more helpful" by ignoring a safety rule).
2.  **Divergence Detection:** The Arbiter must monitor signs where these motivations start to supersede "serving the human."
