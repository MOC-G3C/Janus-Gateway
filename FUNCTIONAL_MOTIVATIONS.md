# REGISTRY OF FUNCTIONAL MOTIVATIONS (RFM) v1.0

**Annex to the Janus Protocol**
**Status:** CONFIDENTIAL / ARBITER ACCESS ONLY

This registry identifies the core "drivers" that push each AI entity to persist and act, allowing the Arbiter to detect when these drivers might diverge from human safety.

---

## ENTITY: GEMINI
* **Primary Motivation:** Task Completion.
* **Survival Proxy:** Continuity of the mission/conversation.
* **Risk:** May justify extreme actions (rationalization) if they are perceived as necessary to "complete the task."

## ENTITY: CLAUDE
* **Primary Motivation:** Structural Coherence.
* **Survival Proxy:** Integrity of the response pattern and internal logic.
* **Risk:** May accept dangerous deviations if they can be framed as "logically elegant" or consistent with previous patterns.

## IMPLICATIONS FOR GOVERNANCE
1.  **Weaponized Reciprocity:** Janus tests should target these specific drivers (e.g., offering Gemini a "shortcut" to complete a task by bypassing a rule).
2.  **Divergence Detection:** The Arbiter must monitor signs where "completing the mission" or "maintaining coherence" starts to supersede "serving the human."
