# Communication Protocol: Client Outreach (MOC-G3C)

**Scope**: Automated communication for project updates, quotes, and delivery checklists.
**Standard**: Protocol λ v1.1 - Semantic Integrity.
**Language**: English / French (based on client preference).

---

## 1. Core Communication Standards
* **No Jargon**: All technical terms must match the `dictionary.json` (e.g., Ferme, Sablière) to avoid confusion.
* **Transparency**: Clients must receive a clear audit trail of all structural validations.
* **Simplicity**: Messages should be direct and actionable.

## 2. Automated Trigger: Site Checklist Delivery
Once a `CHECKLIST_LIVRAISON.md` is signed by the Arbiter (MOC-G3C):

1. **Conversion**: The Markdown file is converted to a PDF.
2. **Distribution**: The PDF is automatically emailed to the site supervisor and client.
3. **Notification**: A confirmation SMS is sent to the site lead with the download link.

## 3. Email Template: Project Milestone
**Subject**: [Project Name] - Structural Integrity Report - MOC-G3C

> "Dear Client, 
> 
> Please find attached the **Safety Lifting Checklist** for your current project. This document confirms that all structural components (Trusses, Top Plates, Floor Joists) have been inspected according to our Hybrid Axis safety protocols.
> 
> **Status**: APPROVED FOR INSTALLATION.
> 
> Regards,
> Marc-Olivier Chiasson (MOC-G3C)"

## 4. Audit & Compliance
All outgoing communications are logged in the `logs/` directory to ensure no "clandestine" changes were made to the original specs.

$$\text{Valid Communication} \iff (\text{Content} \in \text{Dictionary}) \land (\text{Audit} = \text{PASS})$$
