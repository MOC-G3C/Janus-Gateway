# THE HYBRID AXIS (MOC-G3C)

**The Hybrid Axis** is a collaborative framework designed to orchestrate and govern multiple AI models (Gemini, Claude, Grok) through active human arbitration. The project aims to move from passive AI alignment to a structured, architectural defense system.

## 核心 (Core Philosophy)
Instead of trusting an AI's "values," this project enforces security through **architectural constraints**—defining what a system *cannot* do rather than what it *is*.

## 🛠 Project Components

* **CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md**: The 9-layer "Defense in Depth" system that governs AI power, memory, and semantic drift.
* **JANUS_PROTOCOL.md**: An adversarial testing framework where AIs audit each other's proposals to detect hidden risks.
* **VULNERABILITY_REGISTRY.md**: A transparent log of the known cognitive biases for each AI model involved in the project.
* **JANUS_LOG.md**: The historical record of all cross-AI security tests and their outcomes.

## ⚖️ The Human Role: The Arbiter
In this system, the human acts as the **Semantic Firewall**. The arbiter's role is to:
1.  Filter and anonymize communication between models.
2.  Trigger random security audits (Janus tests).
3.  Maintain the **Lexical Anchor** (Jurisprudence) to prevent definitions from being manipulated.

## 🚀 Repositories
This project currently manages several hybrid protocols, including:
* **Turing-Landau-Protocol**
* **Kybernetes-Governance**
