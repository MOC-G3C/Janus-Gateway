# Hybrid Axis Governance: The Simple Method (MOC-G3C)

This guide provides a clear, no-jargon approach to managing your AI models and timber structure projects.

## 1. Core Philosophy (核心 - Héxīn)
We enforce security through **architectural constraints** rather than trust.

* **The Arbiter**: Marc-Olivier (MOC-G3C) is the final decision pivot.
* **Mathematical Trust**: $$\text{Trust}(S) \iff \forall t, \text{Audit}(S, t) \text{ is possible and non-negotiable}$$
* **Transparency**: All AI reasoning must be visible; no "private" logic between models is allowed.

## 2. Your Daily Workflow (3 Steps)
Follow these steps to keep your projects in Sainte-Julie organized and secure:

### Step A: Define Everything in Markdown (.md)
* Use Markdown for all technical specs, quotes, and checklists.
* Standardize documents using the `DEVIS_TEMPLATE.md` to ensure clarity for clients.

### Step B: Lock the Lexicon
* Add every professional term (like Ferme, Sablière) to `protocols/dictionary.json`.
* This prevents the AI from using incorrect jargon or hallucinating definitions.

### Step C: Site Audit
* Open the `CHECKLIST_LIVRAISON.md` on your mobile device at the construction site.
* Verify that physical components match the anchored definitions.

## 3. Visual GitHub Management
Avoid the terminal and manage everything through the GitHub interface on your MacBook Pro M5:

1. **Edit**: Click the **pencil icon** on any `.md` file to update your specs or logs.
2. **Anchor**: Use the **Commit changes** button to save and date-stamp your work.
3. **Audit**: Review the `logs/` folder to ensure all Hybrid Axis activity is recorded.
